# Flask skeleton


This is used as a boilerplate code to start new projects.

## skel

- docker compose for testing 
- flask app
- taiwind for CSS
- alpineJS for dynamic page
- PostgreSQL as database, using connection pool.

## Testing

- rename placeholder files and add information by dev environment.
- tune pg pool according.

## Caveats
- Certificate are for testing.
- Flask doesn't like no ORM (as Django)... internal auth system looks broken.. very boomer...
